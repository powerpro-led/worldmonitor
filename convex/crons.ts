// PRO-launch broadcast ramp runner. Wakes once a day at 13:00 UTC
// (~9am ET / 6am PT / 3pm CET — early enough that any kill-gate
// trip can be triaged within US business hours, late enough that
// overnight bounces and complaints have flowed back via the Resend
// webhook). The action no-ops when no ramp is configured, the ramp
// is paused, kill-gated, or the prior wave hasn't settled yet —
// see `convex/broadcast/rampRunner.ts` for the full state machine.
// Daily retention prune for the plan-limit tables. apiUsageRollups gains a row
// per user per hourly scan and apiPlanLimitNotices accumulates superseded rows,

// silently dropped to ops-only. At 6h cadence first-scan age stays <=~12h, so
// every stuck payment gets its recovery email. Safe to run 4x/day: the action
